/**
 * @file Color Naming Rule (AI-based)
 * @description This rule checks if color styles in the Figma file use semantic naming conventions
 * instead of literal names (e.g., "primary-500" vs. "blue").
 * @functionality It extracts all color style names from the Figma context and generates a
 * prompt for an AI model to analyze them. For now, it returns a placeholder result
 * containing the generated prompt, paving the way for future AI integration without
 * making a live API call.

As an expert in Design Systems, analyze the following list of color style names from a Figma file.
Identify which names are "literal" (e.g., "Blue", "light-grey") and which are "semantic" (e.g., "primary-500", "text-color-danger").
Literal names are a bad practice because they don't describe the color's purpose.

For each literal name, provide a semantic suggestion.

Respond in JSON format with an array of objects, where each object has the keys "literal_name" and "semantic_suggestion".

Color names to analyze:
${colorNames.map(name => `- ${name}`).join('\n')}
